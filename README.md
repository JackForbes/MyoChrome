Chrome Extension for Myo Internet Browsing

Hey there! This is an extension I made that provides a popup "navigation menu" to navigate to popular sites.
This extension was created during a hackathon to provide support for browsing the internet with a Myo.
Currently, the keyboard shortcut to bring up the menu is:

Ctrl-m

You can then tab through the menu and press enter (return) to go to the highlighted site.
BEWARE: This is not a professional extension. The menu doesn't work on a lot of sites and probably has some bugs.
